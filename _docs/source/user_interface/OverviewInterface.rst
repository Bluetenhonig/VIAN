==================
Overview Interface
==================

After you've created a new project and opened the video file, your VIAN interface will look like the following picture:

.. figure:: VIAN_Interface_2.png
   :scale: 70 %
   :align: center
   :alt: map to buried treasure

   Overview of VIAN start window.

Indicated Widgets:

- 1: Video Player
- 2: Screenshot Manager
- 3: Control Panel
- 4: Timeline
- 5: Player Controls

Since this is what you will see when you create a new project, the Timeline and Screenshot Manager look (and are) pretty empty. If you want to know what a prototypical procedure in annotating and analyzing a film from this point on would look like, go to XXX. If you want to know mor about a specific widget seen above, go to YYY.
