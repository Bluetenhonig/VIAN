Classification
==============

The Classification Window is the tool for annotating the Objects with the corresponfing Vocabulary you intend to. In order to be able to perform this task, you need to have two steps already have done:

- The segmentation_ of your movie and
- The Setting up of an experiment_

   The Mask before starting a Classification.

Indicated Information:

- **1**: **Experiment**: Choose the experiment (i.e. the Vocabulary and Objects) you want to use to classify your movie. If you have not set up an Experiment yet you can define one HERE, or you can select the *ERC Advanced Grant FilmColors* which already has Objects and a corresponding Experiment pre-defined.
- **2**: **Mode**: Select the Mode in which you want to carry out your Classification; which means, either you select the Segments manually (you click on them in the **Timeline**), or you classify them sequentally (as seen in the image below).
- **3**: **Sorting Method**: TO DO

After you've specified the required Settings, you will be prompted with a screen that looks like the following for carrying out the Classification:

   The Classification in progress.

Indicated Information:

- **1**: The Indicator at which Segment you are at the moment, and the Buttons for going to the previous and the next Element, respectively (The *Next* and *Previous* Buttons are available only if you've chosen *Sequential Mode*).
- **2**: In this area you will find the Vocabulary that you set up in the **Experiment** Section: In the upper bar the defined Objects and their corresponding Concepts are selectable (as Tabs). In the area below are the actual Words from the Vocabulary with which the Objects are classified.
- **3**: The Progress Bar indicating how far you are in the process of classifying your movie.
- **4**: As you traverse your Segments, the current Segment is highlighted in blue and the Curser jumps automatically to the center of the Segment, so that a representative Frame is being displayed in the **player controls**.
