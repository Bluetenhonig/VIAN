Inspector
=========

The Inspector is one of the most important Widgets of VIAN. It can be activated by **ALT-I** or via the menu bar. The Inspector is content-sensitive, meaning that it
adapts to the current selection. Most of the modifications to a specific item (i.e. a Segmentation, Segment,
Annotation, Screenshot, etc.) can be performed using the Inspector.

The Inspector consists of four distinct parts, which are separated by black lines:

* Title and Name
* Item specific Attributes
* The Vocabulary used to describe the item
* Notes Section
