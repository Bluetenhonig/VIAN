Corpora
=======
A VIAN project only covers one media file, however, usually one wants to analyse
multiple media files using the same template. This is where Corpora come in.

Essentially a corpus is a template and a list of projects.

3. Select an empty folder which should be the root of the corpus, best is to create a new one

Editing Corpus Templates
************************
Once the corpus is created, the corpus manager is activated.
A corpus contains an empty template which can now be edited to your needs,
all projects later added to the corpus will be kept in sync with this template.

To edit the corpus template, do the following:

1. In the control panel, open the corpus manager.
