VIAN Corpus
***********

The VIAN Corpus provides a way to manage project and experiments over a collection of film and generate corpus-spanning
visualizations.
As such, a VIAN Corpus is a database of VIAN Projects, which allows you to define rules for each project that is commited.

There are two types of VIAN Corpora, either local (on your machine, only one can change it at a specific time) or remote,
where multiple users can commit and work on a corpus at the same time.

.. note:: **Local Corporas for Small Groups**
   Although not tested, it is theoretically possible to work on a local corpus (i.e. stored on a local network drive)
   with multiple contributors, but only one may access it at a time.
