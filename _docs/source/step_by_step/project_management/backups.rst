Backups
*******
It is always good idea to create backups of your project on a regular basis.
To do so, do the following steps:

Creating a Backup
#################
1. Navigate to **File/Backup**
2. A Dialog appears asking if you want to save the Backup into the default location which is **<User>/documents/VIAN/backups**, or select your own directory
3. A Zip-File is created with the complete Project. The name of the file is automatically created.

Loading a Backup
################
1. Double click on the Zip-File in your **File-Browser** (Explorer / Finder)
2. Unzip the File where you want to have it.
3. Open the Project with VIAN.
