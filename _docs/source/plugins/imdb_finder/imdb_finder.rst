IMDb Finder
===========


The IMDb Finder is a small Plugin to find the IMDb Ids of a large number of movies.
To Query IMDb do as follows:

1. Import a list of movies by navigating to **File/Import List**
2. The Finder automatically begins to query IMDB for each movie, since this can take quite a while, go get a cup of coffee or take a bath.
3. As soon as the first movie is indicated with "Ready" in the Tablem, click on it and select the correct Title in the found Movies
4. When finished with all movies, navigate to **File/Export List** to export the list with the IMDb-ID

.. note:: **The Import Table**

   The IMDb Finder expects that Following Headers in the Table:

   - MovieName
   - FilemakerID (This can essentially be anything, but make sure to have it in the Table)

   Make sure they are spelled EXACTLY like that.
