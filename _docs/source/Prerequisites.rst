Prerequisites
=============

Before you start a new Project, consider the following points concerning video format, computational resources etc.:

- Make sure that the video you are going to analyse was digitalized with encoding h264 (and not h265 or x265)
- The best suited file format for working with in VIAN is mp4 
- Since VIAN computes the colorimetry of each frame of the movie when you start a new project, this process may take some while (depending on yout hardware up to XXX min)
